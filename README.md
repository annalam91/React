## Purpose of this repository. 

This was mainly created for self-learning journey for React initially.
Currently I will be adding different branches for each project but will separate them in the future.

### Master branch

This for individual learning. So far it has working demos of

* Functional and class based Components
* Props
* Mapping Components
* States
* Conditional Rendering.
* Forms

### Todo-list branch

This is a working demo of a very basic todo-list created solely in React. There is no working API associated with this. All the data is coming from /api/ todoData.js which is hard coded for now.
