## Purpose of this repository. 

This was mainly created for self-learning journey for React initially.
Currently I will be adding different branches for each project but will separate them in the future.

### Master branch

This for individual learning. So far it has working demos of

* Functional and class based Components
* Props
* Mapping Components
* States
* Conditional Rendering.
* Forms
* React Hooks
    * useState
    * useEffect

### Todo-list branch

This is a working demo of a very basic todo-list created solely in React. There is no working API associated with this. All the data is coming from /api/ todoData.js which is hard coded for now. 


### Meme-generator branch

This is a working demo of a meme generator created solely in React. This is calling a valid API when clicking on the Gen button will render a new image. The two text boxes will add the text in the appropiate places. This has been seaparated into their own components.

### recipe-app branch

This is a working demo of a recipe app integrated with firebase, custom hooks, SCSS, React. This is very loosely based of todoist app but adapted to use recipes. Whilst following a youtube tutorial I have also added my own additional touches with the skills I have learnt over time. 

### WeatherApp

This is a working demo of a weather app. Pulling in the data from OpenWeather API with CSS and React. This is a sole project where it was completed within a day not following any tutorials. Although this is completed and working as to how I like it however, the styling is still a work in progress.

### WeatherApp
